## Chapter Zero

Get on a Linux (Bash) command line. I chose to just use my PopOS
desktop (which already has `gcc` 10.3 installed) but I also started
making a Docker container to keep with modern development practices.

I set the `CFLAGS` so that `make` works by default without a `Makefile`
at the moment:

```bash
export CFLAGS="-Wall -Wextra -Werror -O0 -g -fsanitize=address -fno-omit-frame-pointer -finstrument-functions"
```

I went ahead and added these to `~/.bashrc`.

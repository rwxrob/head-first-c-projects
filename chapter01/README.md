# Chapter One

I wrote all this code out in an file and ran it first. Then answered the
questions. See the files associated with it.

> ⚠️ 
> Most of the code examples use libraries that are not
explained anywhere, such as `stdlib.h` for `atoi`, etc. Use `man atoi`
to get more information.

* Use of `strtol` let's you tell the error and set the base (`atoi` does
  not and is considered deprecated by some veterans)
